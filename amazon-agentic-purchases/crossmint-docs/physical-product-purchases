# Physical Product Purchases

> How to purchase physical products with crypto using Headless Checkout

Crossmint's Headless Checkout now supports purchasing physical products using a wallet's crypto balance through the `productLocator` parameter. This guide explains how to integrate physical product purchases and handle shipping requirements.

## Physical Address Requirement

When purchasing physical products, a shipping address is required (currently only US addresses are supported). You can provide this in two ways:

### 1. Include Address During Order Creation

```json
POST /api/2022-06-09/orders
{
    "recipient": {
        "email": "buyer@example.com",
        "physicalAddress": {
            "name": "John Doe", // required
            "line1": "123 Main St", // required
            "line2": "Apt 4B", // optional
            "city": "San Francisco", // required
            "state": "CA", // required for US addresses
            "postalCode": "94105", // required
            "country": "US" // required - only US is currently supported
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Update Address After Order Creation

If you create an order without specifying a `physicalAddress`, the order's quote status will be `requires-physical-address`.

```json response
{
    "order": {
        "orderId": "...",
        "quote": {
            "status": "requires-physical-address"
        }
    }
}
```

To resolve this status, update the order with the physical address:

```json
PATCH /api/2022-06-09/orders/{orderId}
{
  "recipient": {
    "physicalAddress": {
      "name": "John Doe",      // required
      "line1": "123 Main St",  // required
      "line2": "Apt 4B",       // optional
      "city": "San Francisco", // required
      "state": "CA",           // required for US addresses
      "postalCode": "94105",   // required
      "country": "US"          // required - only US is currently supported
    }
  }
}
```

After providing the physical address, the order status will update and include the necessary `payment.preparation` parameters to proceed with payment.

## Order Status Handling

Orders for physical products may enter the following statuses:

* `requires-physical-address` - The order requires a shipping address. During this status, `payment.preparation` parameters will not be present.
* `valid` - The order has all required information and is ready for payment.
